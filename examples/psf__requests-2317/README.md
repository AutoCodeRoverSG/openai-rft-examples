## Introduction

This is the psf\_\_requests-2317 task taken from the [SWE-bench Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/) dataset. See also:

## Takeaway

When dealing with a software issue, the LLM falls short in making reasonable generalizations
and fully addressing the root cause of the issue.

## Input and Output

* Input: [input.json](input.json). This is a conversation between our tool and an LLM that analyzes the issue and finds the correct patching location.

* Actual Output: [output.md](output.md). This contains an LLM-generated patch for the issue. The patch can be reformatted to the diff format, see [output.diff](output.diff).

* Expected Output: [expected_output.diff](expected_output.diff). This is a patch written by a human expert.

For ease of reading, we have also included the [original issue statement](issue_statement.md).

## Detailed Analysis

In this example, the LLM has diagnosed the issue quite accurately, as in [output.md](output.md):

> the problem lies in the `builtin_str` function in the `requests/compat.py` file. The current implementation doesn't handle binary strings (bytes) correctly in Python 3, leading to the undesired behavior of converting `b'GET'` to `"b'GET'"` instead of just `'GET'`. 

Therefore, the LLM fixes the case of `bytes` correctly:

```diff
-        method = builtin_str(method)
+        if isinstance(method, bytes):
+            method = method.decode('utf-8')
+        else:
+            method = builtin_str(method)
```
However, the LLM falls short in making a reasonable **generalization** from the issue and thus
fails to fix the issue completely. Specifically, a reasonable generalization would be to fix all string
compatibility issues related to Python 3: not only `bytes`, but also `bytearray`. Therefore,
a human expert produced the following fix:

```diff
-        method = builtin_str(method)
+        method = to_native_string(method)
```

where `to_native_string` is defined as:

```python
def to_native_string(string, encoding="ascii"):
    if isinstance(string, builtin_str):
        out = string
    else:
        out = string.decode(encoding)

    return out
```

Note that the `else` clause is a "catch-all" that deals with the cases of both `bytes` and `bytearray`.
This generalization is not captured by the LLM-generated patch.

By fine-tuning the LLM for bug fixing tasks, we hope to make LLMs more aware of the root cause of
software issues and of possible generalizations that can be made to fix them. The different possible
generalizations can be explored and presented to an end user. This way, the LLM-generated patches
can become more useful and trustworthy.
